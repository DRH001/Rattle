= is used to set the top of the stack to a value. Given no argument, the top of the stack is set to 0.


[1.6.*]
? can be passed as an argument flag to set the top of the stack to a random value. 
  Given no secondary argument, the top of the stack is set to a random value between 0 and 1.
  Given a secondary argument (as an integer), the top of the stack is set to a random value between 0 and that value (not including that value). Example: =?4 sets the top of the stack to 0, 1, 2, or 3.
