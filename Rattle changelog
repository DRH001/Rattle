Rattle has now officially been released! Rattle is now an imperative language - it's now actually useful for normal programming!




Version 1.5.*: better arguments. Now, round brackets "(", ")" can be used to pass more complex arguments to functions. Example: `=(2*4/3)` will set the top of the stack to 2.66...
                  Note that special characters can be used in the round-bracket arguments - you can use ~,`,@, etc.

Version 1.4.*: added exponentiate, loop iterators, better support for negatives, changed pointedValueInStorageEquals to "v", strings can be used as args for many functions, bugfixes

Version 1.3.*: Much better error handling and debug info

Version 1.2.*: List and array functions have been improved (see documentation). Improved utility for ASCII codes.

Version 1.1.1-1.1.5: small bug fixes and optimizations

In version 1.1.0, loops work slightly differently (they now work more like how loops work in normal languages - see the changelog for more details)
